            Fruits and Such is an orgainization to support and promote fruits and such.
            Fruits are a very important part of your children's nutritional needs.
            People who eat fruits could live a lot longer than people who refuse to eat any type of fruit.
            Eat your fruits regularly and pay an annual visit to your local doctor so that you can stay fit well into your 40s.

            And it can't be stressed enough that you should
            eat as many fruits on a daily basis as is possible
            within the realm of practicality.
            But if you are having a busy day and you can't find time
            to eat fruits as often as is optimal,
            then you can hopefully have at least SOME of the fruit that
            your body needs on a daily basis.

            Here is a list of just some of the fruits you might consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Banana</li>
            <li>Cherries</li>
            <li>Strawberries</li>
            <li>Oranges</li>
            <li>Blue Berries</li>
            <li>Kiwi</li>
            <li>Pineapple</li>
            <li>Peaches</li>
        </ul>
    </main>
    <footer>
