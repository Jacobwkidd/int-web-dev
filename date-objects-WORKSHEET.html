  		//Problem 1
  		//Create a date object by calling the Date constructor function, assign the object to a constant named 'today'.
  		//Invoke the getTime() method of 'today' and log the return value.
  		//Invoke the toDateString() method of 'today' and log the return value.
		const today = new Date();
		today.getTime();
		console.log(today);
		today.toDateString();
		console.log(today);


  		//Problem 2
  		// Use the Date() constructor function to create a date object that represents your birthday.
  		// Pass in parameters to the constructor function to set the date object to your birthday.
  		// Assign the returned object in a constant called 'myBirthday'
  		// BE CAREFUL: Month numbers start with 0, not 1
  		// Then log the date so that it's easy to read your birthday (use the toDateString() method)
		let myBirthday = new Date(2023, 1, 16);
		console.log(myBirthday);
		myBirthday.toDateString();
		console.log(myBirthday);

		



  		//Problem 3
  		// Use the Date constructor function without any parameters to create a date object.
  		// You can store the return object in a constant called 'newYearsEve'.
  		// Then use various methods of the object to set the date to December 31 of the current year.
  		// HINT: you will have to use the following methods: setFullYear(), setMonth(), setDate()
		const newYearsEve = new Date();
		newYearsEve.setFullYear(2023);
		newYearsEve.setMonth(11);
		newYearsEve.setDate(31);
		console.log(newYearsEve);


  		
  		// Problem 4
  		// Write a function that converts milliseconds to days
  		// The function should have a parameter that represents a number of millisceconds
  		// The function should return the equivalent number in days
		function convToDays(milli){
			let second = milli / 1000;
			let hour = second / 3600 ;
			let day = hour / 24;
			return day;
		}

		console.log(convToDays(86400000))
  		// Problem 5
  		// Use the today constant from problem 1 and the newYearsEve constant from problem 3
  		// to figure out how many days from now until newYearsEve.
  		// Hint, figure out the difference in milliseconds, and then use the function that you wrote
  		// for problem 4 to convert the milliseconds to days
		const howManyDays = newYearsEve.getTime() - today.getTime()
		const convt = convToDays(howManyDays)
		console.log(convt);



  		// Bonus Problem
  		// Use various methods of the Date object to determine the significance of the specialDay variable below
  		// Then log a message that explains what day it is
  		var specialDay = new Date(-6106004517529); 
		console.log(specialDay);
		console.log("July 4th 1776 was the day that United States of America independent started from the British Empire and the USA was born.")




  		// Bonus Problem
  		// Write a function called getDayOfWeek(). 
  		// Include a parameter that represents a date object.
  		// The function should return the day name of the parameter
  		// (for example: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday)
  		// When you are done, test the function (pass in today's date), and log the return value
		function getDayOfWeek(dateObj){
			const days = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];
			return days[dateObj.getDay()]
		}
		
		console.log(getDayOfWeek(today));

	<h1>JavaScript Date API Worksheet</h1>
	<h2>Questions</h2>
	<p>This <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp" target="_blank">reference</a> may be helpful in understanding how you can work with Date objects.</p>
	<h4>Question 1</h4>
	<p class="question">
	    If you invoke the Date constructor without passing in any parameters, what date will be stored in the object that is returned?
	</p>
	<div class="answer">
	    Today's date
	</div>

	<h4>Question 2</h4>
	<p class="question">
	    What is an 'epoch'?
	</p>
	<div class="answer">
	    epoch is a coordinated universal time starts at January 1, 1970 and the timer is 00:00:00 then it goes in millisceconds
	</div>

	<h4>Question 3</h4>
	<p class="question">
	    What is a 'Unix timestamp' (also known as 'epoch time')?
	</p>
	<div class="answer">
	    it's a way to track time in millisceconds.
	</div>

	<h4>Question 4</h4>
	<p class="question">
	    What is the actual date of the epoch for Unix timestamps?
	</p>
	<div class="answer">
	    January 1st, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC
	</div>

	<h4>Question 5</h4>
	<p class="question">
	    What does the getTime() method of a date object return (refer to the link that was mentioned above, or find another reference on the Date object in JavaScript)?
	</p>
	<div class="answer">
	    it will display the current time.
	</div>

	<h4>Question 6</h4>
	<p class="question">
	    If you are working with 2 date objects, how could you use the getTime() method to determine if one date is more recent than the other?
	</p>
	<div class="answer">
	    compareTo() 
	</div>
