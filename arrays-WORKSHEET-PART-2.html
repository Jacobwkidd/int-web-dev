	// explain the differences between the splice() and slice() methods
	/*
	Slicing is cutting it from start to finish. If you had 20 objects in an array and cut it at 14, 20 it will slice it at 15th through 20th object.
	Overall slice doesn't effect the array. Splicing is removing, adding, etc values. Splicing changes the value.
